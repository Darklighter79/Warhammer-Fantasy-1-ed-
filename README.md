# Warhammer-Fantasy-1-ed
This is my Warahmmer Fantasy 1 ed. repository. I will be adding new programs here that help GMs and players in their adventures.

For now you have to programs available:
Skill_roll.py
Used for testing any skill including multiple attacks.
You get info how sucessful/unsucessful was the roll.
I also introduced critical failure at 96-100 (some house rule as normally it was on doubles lik 66, 77, 88 ect.)

Damage_roll.py
Used for testing damage.
Additional damage roll at natural "6" and next 6s (aka Fury of Ulric).
